# simple-httpfs

A simple FUSE-based http file system. Read http files as if they were on
the local filesystem.

## Usage

```
simple-http /my/mount/dir
curl /my/mount/dir/http/slashdot.org/country.js..
```

URLs are referenced relative to the mount directory and suffixed with `..` in
the style of [Daniel Rozenbergs
httpfs](https://github.com/danielrozenberg/httpfs).

## Unmounting

```
umount /my/mount/dir
```


## Local development

```
git clone https://github.com/higlass/simple-httpfs.git
cd simple-httpfs
pip install .
# To run the test script
bash test.sh
```
